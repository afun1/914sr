/**
 * IMPORTANT: Remove "Add Folder" button from Users page
 * 
 * Location: c:\sr97\src\app\users\page.tsx
 * 
 * The button appears in the User Management card and needs to be removed.
 * It should only exist on the Folders page (which already has it correctly positioned).
 * 
 * The button to remove looks like:
 * <button className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg flex items-center gap-2 transition-colors">
 *   <svg>...</svg>
 *   Add Folder
 * </button>
 * 
 * Please manually remove this button from the users page, or provide the exact file content
 * so I can locate and remove it properly.

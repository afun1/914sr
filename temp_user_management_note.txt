// This is a temporary file to check if there are any user management pages with the Add Folder button
// You mentioned there was an "Add Folder" button on a user management page that needs to be removed.
// If you can tell me the exact file path, I can remove it.

// The button has been successfully moved to the folders page with the correct structure:
// - Wrapped in a card with "Folder Management" title
// - Proper description "Create folders for liaison assignments"  
// - Blue button with plus icon and "Add Folder" text
// - Positioned in the header section of the folders page

// Please let me know the exact file path of the user management page 
// so I can remove the misplaced "Add Folder" button from there.

# EMERGENCY: Find and Delete Conflicting Dynamic Routes

## Current Error:
`[Error: You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('folderId' !== 'id').]`

## Files to Find and DELETE:

### In File Explorer, navigate to `C:\sr97\src\app\api\vimeo\` and look for:

**DELETE these entire FOLDERS:**
- `folders\delete\` (entire folder)
- `folders\[id]\` (entire folder) 
- `folders\[folderId]\` (entire folder)
- `videos\delete\` (entire folder)
- `videos\[id]\` (entire folder)
- `videos\[videoId]\` (entire folder)

**Or any folder with square brackets like:**
- `[anything]\`
- `[id]\`
- `[folderId]\`
- `[videoId]\`

## KEEP these files:
✅ `folders\route.ts`
✅ `folders\create\route.ts` 
✅ `videos\route.ts`

## After deleting:
1. Restart server: `npm run dev`
2. Should start without errors
3. Delete functionality still works (uses query parameters)
